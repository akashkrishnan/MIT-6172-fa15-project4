This directory contains the codebase for the main game engine, leiserchess.

leiserchess.c:

	The main file that implements the UCI specification and invokes
everything else. In UCI, when you type "go", a call is made to the search
routine. To do so, a series of function calls happen : UciBeginSearch ->
entry_point -> searchRoot in search.c


search.c:
	Implements the search routine (Principal Variation Search). Includes
functions, searchRoot and searchPV (alpha-beta pruning). searchRoot first makes
a call to scout_search in search_scout.c, followed by a call to searchPV.


search_scout.c
	Implements the low cost null-window search, which is used in PVS
search.

search_common.c
	Implements some search logic that is shared by the searchRoot, searchPV, and
scout_search routines.

search_globals.c
	Implements the global killer-move table and best-move-history tables.

eval.c:
	The static evaluator that implements different heuristics of the
player.

move_gen.c:
        Implements the board representation.

tt.c:
	Implements the transposition table used by the player (a hashtable
storing positions seen by the player and some other relevant information for
evaluating a position).

util.c:
	Utility functions, such as random number generator, printing debugging
messages, etc.

fen.c:
	The UCI uses the FEN notations (see description of the FEN notation in
doc/engine-interface.txt), so the program needs to translate a FEN string into
the underlying board representation, and this file contains that logic.
