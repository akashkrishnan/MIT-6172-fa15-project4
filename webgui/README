SETUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Locally or in your AWS instance: 
- Compile leiserchess in player/. (Note that you will need to have a local installation 
  of cilk to compile leiserchess in your machine)
- cd into webgui.
- Start the webserver via 'python ./webserver.py' and leave it running.
  It should print out "start Leiserchess at port 5555."
- If you ran the webserver in your local machine 
     - Open a browser and type 'localhost:5555'
  If you ran the webserver in your AWS instance
     - First login to your AWS console via aws.amazon.com and note the public IP address
       of your running instance
     - Open a browser and type '<public_ip>:5555' 
- Click 'Start' and enjoy the game! (Refer to the README file in the webgui/ folder for controls)
  By default, this configuration is human versus bot (specially, the 
  "leiserchess" in player/)
  (Note: We will later support human-to-human and bot-to-bot interface.)
- Once you are done, remember to shut down your webserver (Ctrl-C on the 
  terminal that you ran python webserver.py).

Sometimes the webserver doesn't die properly, hanging up the port and
preventing a new webserver from starting.  In this case, type

    $ lsof -i :5555

Note the PID of the python job, and type

    $ kill <PID>

PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The web interface should be fairly intuitive. Each player takes turns and a turn ends 
when you fire the laser.

Movements 
 - Each piece can be moved one square at a time simply by doing a drag and drop.
 - To rotate a piece simply click on it multiple times until the desired angle of rotation is
   reached.
 - The web interface will notify you if you make an invalid move. 
 - You / Your bot will have 2 minutes to make a move.
   2 minute rule is not strictly enforced in this web interface. But for autotesting and 
   for the final run of your bot, it WILL be enforced and you will lose the game if your bot 
   does not come up with a move within this time.
